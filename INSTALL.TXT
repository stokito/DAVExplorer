Installation procedure

DAV Explorer requires Java 2 (tested with both JDK 1.2.x and JDK 1.3.0).

1. Login to the DAV Explorer CVS archive with the command
   'cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@elysees.ics.uci.edu:/webdav'
   The password for the cvsguest account is: cvs

2. Navigate to your chosen source directory.

3. Retrieve all DAV Explorer source files from the DAV Explorer CVS archive,
   by using the command
   'cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@elysees.ics.uci.edu:/webdav checkout DAVExplorer'.
   Retrieve all MS Parser and HTTPClient source files and class files from the
   CVS archive with the commands
   'cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@elysees.ics.uci.edu:/webdav checkout parser'
   and 'cvs -d :pserver:cvsguest@elysees.ics.uci.edu:/webdav checkout HTTPClient',
   respectively.

4. Compile all Java source files with Java 2 by running make in the dav_explorer
   directory directly below your source directory. This also creates a
   DAVExplorer.jar file in the dav_explorer directory.
   Note that the Makefile does not work under MS Windows. Instead, running the
   make.bat file in the dav_explorer directory achieves the same result.
   Under MS Windows, you can also run the DAVjar.bat file from the dav_explorer
   directory to create the DAVExplorer.jar file.
   Under Unix, the DAVjar.sh shell script serves the same purpose.

5. If SSL support is required, retrieve the Java Secure Socket Extensions from
   http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/
   Install the JSSE files according to the JSSE documentation.
   Make sure that the appropriate X.509 certificates are installed at the
   Webserver.

6. Run the DAV Explorer.
   Under MS Windows, run the DAVExplorer.bat file from the dav_explorer directory.
   Under Unix, run the DAVExplorer.sh shell script from the dav_explorer directory.
   You can also run DAVExplorer by using the command 'java -jar DAVExplorer.jar'.
   For SSL support, run DAVExplorerSSL.bat or DAVExplorerSSL.sh, respectively.
   Alternatively, the command 'java -jar -Dssl=true DAVExplorer.jar' can be used.
