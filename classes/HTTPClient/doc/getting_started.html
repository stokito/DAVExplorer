<H2><A NAME="sending">Sending Requests</A></H2>

<P>Using the HTTPClient should be quite simple. First add the import
statement <code>import HTTPClient.*;</code> to your file(s). Next you
create an instance of <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html">HTTPConnection</A> (you'll
need one for every server you wish to talk to). Requests can then be
sent using one of the methods <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html#Head(java.lang.String)">Head()</A>,
<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html#Get(java.lang.String)">Get()</A>,
<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html#Post(java.lang.String)">Post()</A>,
etc in <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html">HTTPConnection</A>.  These
methods all return an instance of <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html">HTTPResponse</A> which has
methods for accessing the response headers (<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getHeader(java.lang.String)">getHeader()</A>,
<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getHeaderAsInt(java.lang.String)">getHeaderAsInt()</A>,
etc), various response info (<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getStatusCode()">getStatusCode()</A>,
<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getReasonLine()">getReasonLine()</A>,
etc), the reponse data (<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getData()">getData()</A> and
<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getInputStream()">getInputStream()</A>)
and any trailers that might have been sent (<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getTrailer(java.lang.String)">getTrailer()</A>,
<A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getTrailerAsInt(java.lang.String)">getTrailerAsInt()</A>,
etc). Following are some examples to get started.

<P>If this is in an applet you can retrieve files from your server
as follows:

<pre>
    try
    {
	HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(this);
	HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Get("/my_file");
	if (rsp.getStatusCode() &gt;= 300)
	{
	    System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
	    System.err.println(new String(rsp.getData(),0));
	}
	else
	    data = rsp.getData();

	rsp = con.Get("/another_file");
	if (rsp.getStatusCode() &gt;= 300)
	{
	    System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
	    System.err.println(new String(rsp.getData(),0));
	}
	else
	    other_data = rsp.getData();
    }
    catch (IOException ioe)
    {
	System.err.println(ioe.toString());
    }
    catch (ModuleException me)
    {
	System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
    }
</pre>

<P>This will get the files "/my_file" and "/another_file" and put their
contents into byte[]'s accessible via <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getData()">getData()</A>.
Note that you need to only create a new <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html">HTTPConnection</A> when
sending a request to a new server (different protocol, host or port);
although you may create a new <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html">HTTPConnection</A> for
every request to the same server this <strong>not</strong> recommended,
as various information about the server is cached after the first
request (to optimize subsequent requests) and persistent connections
are used whenever possible (see also <A
HREF="advanced_info.html">Advanced Info</A>).

<P>To POST form data you would use something like this (assuming you
have two fields called <var>name</var> and <var>e-mail</var>, whose
contents are stored in the variables <var>name</var> and <var>email</var>):

<pre>
    try
    {
	NVPair form_data[] = new NVPair[2];
	form_data[0] = new NVPair("name", name);
	form_data[1] = new NVPair("e-mail", email);

	HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(this);
	HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Post("/cgi-bin/my_script", form_data);
	if (rsp.getStatusCode() &gt= 300)
	{
	    System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
	    System.err.println(new String(rsp.getData(),0));
	}
	else
	    stream = rsp.getInputStream();
    }
    catch (IOException ioe)
    {
	System.err.println(ioe.toString());
    }
    catch (ModuleException me)
    {
	System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
    }
</pre>

<P>Here the response data is read at leasure via an <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getInputStream()">InputStream</A>
instead of all at once into a <var>byte[]</var>.

<P>As another example, if you want to upload a document to a URL (and the
server supports http PUT) you could do something like the following:

<pre>
    try
    {
	URL url = new URL("http://www.mydomain.us/test/my_file");
	HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(url);
	HTTPResponse   rsp = con.Put(url.getFile(), "Hello World");
	if (rsp.getStatusCode() &gt= 300)
	{
	    System.err.println("Received Error: "+rsp.getReasonLine());
	    System.err.println(new String(rsp.getData(),0));
	}
	else
	    data = rsp.getData();
    }
    catch (IOException ioe)
    {
	System.err.println(ioe.toString());
    }
    catch (ModuleException me)
    {
	System.err.println("Error handling request: " + me.getMessage());
    }
</pre>


<H2><A NAME="example">Example Applet</A></H2>

<P>Here is a complete (albeit simple) <A HREF="HTTPClientExample.html">
Applet</A> that uses HTTPClient to POST some data.


<H2><A NAME="auth">Authorization Handling</A></H2>

<P>If the server requires authorization the HTTPClient will usually pop
up a dialog box requesting the desired information (usually username
and password), much like Netscape or other browsers do. This
information will then be cached so that further accesses to the same
realm will not require the information to be entered again. If you (as
a programmer) know the username and password beforehand (e.g. if you
are writing an applet to access a specific page on your server) you can
set this information with the <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html#addBasicAuthorization">addBasicAuthorization()</A>
and <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html#addDigestAuthorization">addDigestAuthorization()</A>
methods in <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html">HTTPConnection</A>, or via
the corresponding methods in <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.AuthorizationInfo.html">AuthorizationInfo</A>.
Example:

<pre>
    HTTPConnection con = new HTTPConnection(this);
    con.addBasicAuthorization("protected-space", "goofy", "woof");
</pre>

<P>Note that for applets it is not possible to pick up authorization info
from the browser (even though I would love to) because this would of
course constitute a largish security problem (imagine an applet that gets
all the username/passwords from the browser and sends them back to the
server...).  This means that the user of an applet might potentially have
to enter information (s)he's already entered before.

<P>If you are using a proxy which requires authentication then this will
be handled in the same way as server authentication. However, you will
need to use the methods from <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.AuthorizationInfo.html">AuthorizationInfo</A> for
setting any auth info. Example:

<pre>
    AuthorizationInfo.addBasicAuthorization("my.proxy.dom", 8000, "protected-space", "goofy", "woof");
</pre>

<P>By default HTTPClient will handle both Basic and Digest authentication
schemes.


<H3>Authorization Realms</H3>

<P>All <code>addXXXAuthorization()</code> methods take one argument
labeled <var>realm</var>. But what is a realm?

<P>Username/Password pairs are associated with realms, not URLs. This
allows the same authorization info to be used for multiple URLs, or
even whole URL trees. When a server sends back an "unauthorized" error
it includes the name of the realm this URL belongs to. The client can
then look and see whether it has stored a username and password for
this realm, and if so it will send that info without prompting the user
(again).  If the info were associated with specific URLs then you would
have to enter the username and passsword each time you accessed a
different URL.

<P>To find out what realm a given URL belongs to you can either access
the URL with a normal browser and see what realm they give in the popup
box (in Netscape it says "Enter Username for .... at www.some.host" -
the .... is the realm), or you can access the URL using the HTTPClient
(without the <code>addXXXAuthorization()</code> method) and see what
realm it prints in the popup box (it'll say "Enter username and
password for realm .... on host www.some.host"). Additionally, I've
provided a small application <var>GetAuthInfo</var> (in HTTPClient/doc/)
which will print out the necessary info. You can run this as:
<PRE>
	java GetAuthInfo http://some.host.dom/the/file.html
</PRE>
If you're using an http proxy, use
<PRE>
	java -Dhttp.proxyHost=your.proxy.dom -Dhttp.proxyPort=XX GetAuthInfo http://some.host.dom/the/file.html
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
	java -Dhttp.proxyHost=your.proxy.dom -Dhttp.proxyPort=XX GetAuthInfo -proxy_auth proxy-username proxy-password http://some.host.dom/the/file.html
</PRE>


<H2><A NAME="redir">Redirections</A></H2>

<P>Redirections (status codes 301, 302, 303, 305 and 307) are handled
automatically for the request methods GET and HEAD; other requests are
not redirected as a redirection might change the conditions under which
the request was made (this is mandated by <A
HREF="advanced_info.html#specs">the specs</A>). An exception are the
302 and 303 response codes - upon receipt of either of these a GET is
issued to the new location, no matter what the original request method
was. This is used primarily for scripts which are accessed via POST
and want to redirect the client to a predetermined response.

<P>If the request was redirected (it may even have been redirected
multiple times) the final URL that delivered the response can be
retrieved using the response's <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPResponse.html#getEffectiveURL()">getEffectiveURL()</A>
method.


<H2><A NAME="cookies">Cookies</A></H2>

Cookies are now handled too. However, because of privacy issues surrounding
these a cookie policy handler is used to control the accepting and sending
of cookies. By default, when the server tries to set a cookie a dialog box
is brought up to ask the user whether the cookie should be accepted. This
allows her simple control over which cookies are set. For more info on
disabling cookies or using your own policy handler see the
<A HREF="advanced_info.html#cookie_module">Advanced Info</A>.


<H2><A NAME="parsing">Parsing Headers</A></H2>

<P>The <A HREF="api/HTTPClient.Util.html">Util</A> class provides a
number of methods for handling http headers. They are mostly based
around the general header parser <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.Util.html#parseHeader(java.lang.String)">parseHeader()</A>
which will parse a syntax that fits most http headers. It's also a very
loose parser that will accept just about anything as long as it's
unambigously parseable.


<H2><A NAME="urlcon">Replacing the JDK's HttpClient</A></H2>

<P>An <A HREF="api/HTTPClient.HttpURLConnection.html">HttpURLConnection</A>
class and the necessary <code>URLStreamHandlers</code> are provided so that
you may easily replace the JDK's HttpClient with the HTTPClient. All you
need to do is define the property <var>java.protocol.handler.pkgs</var> as
<var>HTTPClient</var>. For example, on the command line this would look
like
<PRE>
    java -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=HTTPClient MyApp
</PRE>
Invoking <code>URL.openConnection()</code> will then return an instance
of <A
HREF="api/HTTPClient.HttpURLConnection.html">HTTPClient.HttpURLConnection</A>.
You can also use this to run HotJava with the HTTPClient - this gives you
an HTTP/1.1 capable browser.
