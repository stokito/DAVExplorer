<H1>Running under JDK 1.0.2 (or equivalent)</H1>

<P>If you wish to run the client under JDK 1.0.2 then you must copy
the classes in the <var>alt/jdk_1.0.2/</var> subdirectory to the
<var>HTTPClient</var> directory. This subdirectory contains JDK 1.0.2
compatible replacements for the <var>Util</var>, <var>HTTPResponse</var>,
<var>HttpURLConnection</var>, <var>Cookie</var>, and <var>CookieModule</var>
classes and for the popup boxes (both sources and class files are provided).
All the other classes will run fine as they are under JDK 1.0.2. However,
under JDK 1.0.2 the functionality is restricted as follows:

<UL>
<P><LI>The <A HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html#setTimeout">timeout</A>
    won't influence the reading of the responses. This is because JDK
    1.0.2 didn't support a timeout for Sockets. The timeout will still
    work for creating connections, though.
<P><LI><A HREF="api/HTTPClient.HTTPConnection.html#stop">stop()</A> may
    hang on some systems for a while. This is because the socket option
    SO_LINGER cannot be disabled (SO_LINGER controls whether a close()
    will wait until all pending data has been sent, or whether it will 
    return immediately).
<P><LI>The TransferEncodingModule and ContentEncodingModule will be
    disabled. They both use the GZIPInputStream and DeflateInputStream
    which are only avaialble in JDK 1.1 or later.
<P><LI>Cookies cannot be saved and restored between invocations (JDK 1.0.2
    did not have serialization).
</UL>

<P>Note also that this version of the HTTPClient won't compile under
JDK 1.0.2. There are a few calls to methods which only exist in JDK 1.1
or later. These are protected by try/catch statements so that the code
will still run under JDK 1.0.2, but to compile it you'll have to
comment these out.
