<H1>A Comparison of java.net.URLConnection and HTTPClient</H1>

<P>Since java.net.URLConnection and HTTPClient have overlapping
functionalities, the question arises of why would you use HTTPClient.
Here are a few of the capabilites and tradeoffs.

<P><TABLE BORDER=3 BGCOLOR="#FAF0E6">
<TR><TH></TH>
  <TH><P>URLConnection</TH>
  <TH><P>HTTPClient</TH>
<TR><TH><P>Methods</TH>
  <TD><P>JDK 1.0.2: Only has GET and POST.
      <BR>JDK 1.1: HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and OPTIONS
  <TD><P>Has HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and OPTIONS, plus any
      arbitrary method.
<TR><TH><P>Headers</TH>
  <TD><P>You can only set request headers if you are using JDK 1.1 or doing a
	 POST under Netscape; for GETs in Netscape and when using JDK 1.0.2
	 you can't set any headers.
     <BR>Under Netscape 3.0 you can read headers only if the resource was
	 returned with a Content-length header; if no Content-length header
	 was returned, or under previous versions of Netscape, or using the
	 JDK 1.0.2 no headers can be read. All headers can be read in JDK 1.1.
  <TD><P>Allows any arbitrary headers to be sent and received.
<TR><TH><P>Proxies and SOCKS</TH>
  <TD><P>Full support in Netscape browser, appletviewer, and applications 
      (SOCKS: Version 4 only); no additional limitations from security
      policies.
  <TD><P>Full support (SOCKS: Version 4 and 5); limited in applets however by
      security policies; in Netscape can't pick up the settings from the
      browser.
<TR><TH><P>Authorization</TH>
  <TD><P>Full support for Basic Authentication in Netscape (can use info
      given by the user for normal accesses outside of the applet); no
      support in appletviewer or applications.
  <TD><P>Support for Basic and Digest Authentication; other schemes can be
      added. However cannot access info from a browser, thereby possibly
      requiring the user to enter info (s)he has already given for a
      previous access.
<TR><TH><P>Automatic Redirection Handling</TH>
  <TD><P>Yes.
  <TD><P>Yes (as allowed by the HTTP/1.1 spec).
<TR><TH><P>Cookies</TH>
  <TD><P>No.
  <TD><P>Yes.
<TR><TH><P>Persistent Connections</TH>
  <TD><P>HTTP/1.0 Keep-Alive's in JDK 1.1 and under Netscape; no persistence
	 in JDK 1.0.2.
  <TD><P>Supports HTTP/1.0 Keep-Alive's and HTTP/1.1 persistence.
<TR><TH><P>Pipelining of Requests</TH>
  <TD><P>No.
  <TD><P>Yes.
<TR><TH><P>Can handle protocols other than HTTP</TH>
  <TD><P>Theoretically; however only http is currently implemented.
  <TD><P>No.
<TR><TH><P>Can do HTTP over SSL (https)</TH>
  <TD><P>Under Netscape, yes. Using Appletviewer or in an application, no.
  <TD><P>No (not yet).
<TR><TH><P>Source code available</TH>
  <TD><P>No.
  <TD><P>Yes.
