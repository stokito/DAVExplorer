This is Version 0.3-1 of the HTTPClient package. The latest version should
always be available at http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/ .

The HTTPClient is fairly full-featured http client library. It implements
most of the relevant parts of HTTP/1.1, and automatically handles things
like redirections, authorization, and cookies. The functionality can be
easily extended through the use of modules.


Installation:
-------------

Unpacking the .tar.Z or .zip should've created a subdirectory
'HTTPClient'. Put this directory somewhere in your classpath. If you
haven't done the following already I recommend setting up a main
directory that contains a subdirectory for every java package you
install, and then add this main directory to your classpath - that way
for new packages all you have to do is unpack them into a subdirectory
under the main directory and away you go. Now add a 'import
HTTPClient.*;' statement to each of your files that use any part of the
package and you're set to go.
