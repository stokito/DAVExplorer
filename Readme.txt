1. OVERVIEW

DAV Explorer is a WebDAV client application that uses the WebDAV protocol
to provide:
     A tree view of a WebDAV server 
     Upload and download of Web resources 
     Locking and unlocking of resources for collaboration support 
     Display all resource properties, or just lock properties 
     Copying collections and individual resources 
     Renaming of individual resources 
     Creating new collections 
     Delete collections or individual resources 
     Logging of protocol activity 

The user interface for DAV Explorer is similar in look and functionality
to the Explorer program which is provided by the Windows operating system.
DAV Explorer is a useful tool for interoperability testing a WebDAV server,
since it is capable of exercising the majority of the functionality
specified in RFC 2518, the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol
specification, while logging the protocol stream. However, DAV Explorer can
also be used for remote namespace management, and has collaboration support
for groups which employ a lock-download-work-upload-unlock authoring
process.

DAV Explorer is a Java application which uses Java 2 (tested with both
JDK 1.2 and JDK 1.3). and has successfully been run on Windows
95/98/ME/NT/2000 machines, Solaris and Linux. It has been reported to run on
Macintosh computers, with MacOS 9 and MRJ 2.2.3, and with Mac OS X.
DAV Explorer may run on other platforms, but this has not been verified.

4. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

DAV Explorer accepts the following command line options:

-Ddebug=option
  where option is one of:
  all          all function traces are enabled
  request      function traces related to HTTP requests are enabled
  response     function traces related to HTTP responses are enabled
  treeview     function traces related to the tree view on the left
  		side of the DAVExplorer window are enabled
  treenode     function traces related to each node in the tree view
  		are enabled
  fileview     function traces related to the file view on the right
  		side of the DAVExplorer window are enabled

-Dpropfind=allprop
  This option results in using the <allprop> tag in PROPFIND.
  
-DSSL=yes
  This option enables the use of SSL.
  
-DSharePoint=yes
  This option enables a workaround for a bug in Microsoft's SharePoint
  server which allows tags to start with a digit.
  
-DApache=yes
  This option enables a workaround for a bug in Apache 1.3.x, which returns
  a 500 error in response to a PROPPATCH if the Host: header contains a
  port number.

-Dlocal=no
  This option prevents showing the local directory structure in the
  main DAV Explorer window.


5. CHANGELOG

Changes for version 0.82-dev:
- Made sure that DAV Explorer runs with JDK 1.1.x, for MacOS 9 compatibility
- Updated to run with JDK 1.4 on Windows
- Incorporated Karen Schuchardt's changes to improve the loading of images
- Added the -Dlocal option to disable reading and showing the local
  directory structure.

Changes for version 0.81:
- Fixed handling of default namespace in the view/modify property dialog
- Fixed menu selection of view/modify properties dialog
- Fixed problems with property addition to root
- Apache 1.3.x workaround: PROPPATCH returns a 500 error if the Host: header
  contains the port number. The workaround is activated with the option
  -DApache=yes
- Made the MS SharePoint workaround optional. It is activated with the
  following command line: java -jar -DSharePoint=true DAVExplorer.jar
- Improved handling of non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
- Improved the logging of chunked data.
- Now allowing untrusted certificates by presenting a choice to the user.
- Fixed problems with modifying nested properties.
- Unified option selection to yes/no.

Changes for version 0.80:
- Makefile for HTTPClient now works with JSSE installed as "bundled"
  extension.
- Fixed handling of EOF for whitespace after the final tag (interoperability
  bug with Adobe InScope).
- Changed the parser code to allow tag names starting with a digit
  (interoperability problem with Microsoft SharePoint (a bug in SharePoint)).
- Removed whitespace in the created XML for lockowner and keepalive
  properties.
- Interoperability problem fixed for cases when properties for a collection
  and its contents are requested and the server doesn't send properties for
  the collection itself.
- Modified the authentication code to make use of the HTTPClient
  functionality   for Digest authentication.
- Copy and Move now allow entering the target, making them more flexible.
- For initial contact with a server, we now send an OPTIONS request.
- Rewrite of the View Property dialog.
- PROPPATCH support implemented (finally).
- The package name of the main DAVExplorer files was changed to
  edu.uci.ics.DAVExplorer.

Changes for version 0.72:
- Support for operation through proxy servers
- Update to HTTPClient 0.3.3

Changes for version 0.71:
- Fixed bug in HTTPClient that prevented proper handling of authentication in
  case the server allows multiple possible authentication headers (thanks to
  Thierry Janaudy for alerting us to this problem).
- Fixed broken handling of & in filenames in the MS parser (thanks to Dennis
  Craig for alerting us to this problem).
- Now using the standard https port (443) for requests with SSL.
- Closing the properties dialog with the close button does not exit the
  application anymore.

Changes for version 0.70:
- Support for SSL (https protocol)
  The SSL package supported is Sun's Java Secure Socket Extensions 1.0.2
  (JSSE), available at http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/
  SSL is activated with the following command line:
  java -jar -Dssl=true DAVExplorer.jar
  If a self-certified certificate is used, the certificate has to be added
  to the JSSE keystore with the keytool program from the Java JDK.
  On MS Windows, JSSE ignores the default keystore, instead, the certificate
  has to be stored in a particular JSSE keystore located in the JRE directory
  tree, usually at JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts
- Compatibility with JDK 1.3 was confirmed. The DAVExplorer.jar file is now
  created with JDK 1.3.0
- Interoperability problem (another SiblingEnumeration bug in the parser)
  with IIS 5.0 fixed (thanks to Ron Gutfinger for alerting us to this
  problem).

Changes for version 0.62:
- Improved recovery after server timeout

Changes for version 0.61:
- Added check for CDATA to improve interoperability for Sharemation's server.
- Changed the enumeration in parseResponse() to SiblingEnumeration to
  avoid parsing the wrong href tag (thanks to Michelle Harris for
  alerting us to this problem).
- Fixed string comparison in case of multiple <propstat> tags.
- href tag is now stripped from lock owner string (thanks to Eric Giguere
  for submitting this fix).

Changes for version 0.60:
- Fixed logging of incoming data.
- The DAV4J workaround (see below in the changes for version 0.57) is also
  required for locking support with mod_dav up to version 0.9.16.

Changes for version 0.59:
- Interoperability problem with www.sharemation.com fixed.
- The authentication dialog now acts as Authentication Handler for
  HTTPClient.

Changes for version 0.58:
- Fix interoperability problem with Glyphica server:
  The Glyphica server returns a wrong locktoken field, and DAV Explorer
  did not react to this properly.

Changes for version 0.57:
- Workaround for interoperability with DAV4J
  The workaround is activated with the following command line:
  java -jar -Dpropfind=allprop DAVExplorer.jar

Changes for version 0.56:
- DAVExplorer is now instrumented for function trace output.
  Function trace output is enabled by running DAVExplorer with the following
  command line:
  java -jar -Ddebug=option DAVExplorer.jar
  where option is one of:
  all                   all function traces are enabled
  request               function traces related to HTTP requests are enabled
  response              function traces related to HTTP responses are enabled
  treeview              function traces related to the tree view on the left
  			side of the DAVExplorer window are enabled
  treenode              function traces related to each node in the tree view
  			are enabled
  fileview              function traces related to the file view on the right
  			side of the DAVExplorer window are enabled
  The trace output is written to stderr.
